This project is a simulation of a ticket booking system and information interface for a metro rail system, specifically designed for Hyderabad Metro. Key features include ticket booking, checking seat availability, displaying recent booking history, listing all stations, showing the metro map, and providing information about nodes and edges in the metro network. The system employs algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths between stations, and it allows users to interact with the system through a graphical user interface built using Tkinter in Python. The project integrates concepts of data structures like graphs, linked lists, and queues to manage passenger records, waiting lists, and ticket bookings efficiently. Additionally, it provides functionalities for calculating fares based on distance traveled and displays relevant information to users dynamically.
